    "PRESENTATION" : "Hi I'm Joel, a <strong>Frontend Developer and Interactive Designer </strong> who has been working in several projects with <strong>React, NextJS, Angular and Vue.js</strong> since 2019. As an IT professional I am interested in challenging projects that keep me permanently learning. Also I like to implement new technologies, best practices, libraries and frameworks in the projects I work. Furthermore, since 2023, I had the opportunity to start coordinating the team I worked with, so I began to be interested in management and tasks related to leadership and teams coordination. I consider myself a curious person who enjoys growing as a professional, working on projects in different areas."
